Data Science and Self Driving Cars

# Abstract
Our generation has witnessed many technological advances and one such noteworthy advancement is autonomous vehicles. Like many technological inventions, self-driving cars (SDC) were once considered science fiction. From the prototypes to the present-day models, self-driving cars have come a long way. As of today, autonomous driving has yet to overcome many technical and socioeconomic hurdles to be accepted by the human race irrespective of geographical differences.
Our research is focused to study the involvement and importance of data science in making self-driving cars a reality. The progressive development of self-driving cars is nourished by advancements in data science. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are committed to overcoming these hurdles and taking autonomous driving a step closer to real-world existence. In our ‘Dream project’ we will demonstrate how machine learning and Big data have been the driving forces behind self-driving cars and how data science will help overcome the bottlenecks.
